This should be a double play.
one for profit, one for nonprofit.
For profit is to see what kind of people it attracts to.

This project I want to create is to make information, become backbone of interconnectivity, by discovery of data, calculatining knowning model or algorithm, and leveling the dependency between humanity and external tools.
The first step was to create discover of data
Second step is create collection of algorithms and semantic value association of values
Lastly, create tools that have end means that solves issues like: death, love and equality.
